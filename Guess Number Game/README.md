# 🎯 Guess the Number Game

A simple and fun Python terminal game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## 📘 Description

This project is a command-line guessing game built in Python.  
When you start the game, the program picks a random number between **1** and **10**, and you have to guess what it is.

The game keeps track of how many attempts it takes for you to guess correctly and saves your scores for comparison.  
If you play multiple times, it will display your **best score (fewest attempts)** so far.
